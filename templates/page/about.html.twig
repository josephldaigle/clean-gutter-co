                <p>Welcome, I'm Joe, and I'm the owner/operator of Clean Gutter Co.</p>

                <p>I'd like you to know that I'm on a mission to provide you with the safest and easiest way to get your gutters cleaned. We use a super-powered vacuum system to 'suck' leaves and dirt from your gutters, so we don't have to climb on your house or roof. And there's no risk of anyone falling - that's always good news.</p>

                <p>Being veteran-owned, you can count on us to strive for excellence in all we do.</p>



                <p>I'd like to share a little about me, and why I started this business.</p>

                <p>I grew up right here in Central Georgia, and spent most of my adult life in the Marines, touring the world, and running and yelling a lot. After my time in the service, I decide to move home and let my family settle down. My wife, Maxine, and daughters, Chloe and Layla are my three lovely companions on this journey. Needless to say, I'm quite outnumbered and over-matched. But I've managed to keep my rights to the remote control, so far!</p>

                <p>Now, I'm on a mission to clean every gutter in town!</p>

                <p>I realize that your home is likely the largest investment you'll make in your lifetime. Not just financially, but in many other ways. Think about the memories you create there with your family. I believe that your home should be well maintained, so those memories are good ones, and so you don't have to cancel your bbq so the excavator can dig up your foundation! Don't clean your gutters, and you may have to do just that!</p>

                <p>I also believe that you should be able to hire someone you can trust, and who uses the best methods available to do the safest, best job possible.</p>
                <p>Deciding to hire someone to maintain your home can be dicey. There are a lot of businesses out there, and choosing the right person, who employs the right methods, and has the right skills shouldn't be difficult. You should trust the person you hire.</p>



                <p>What does it have to do with safety? Well, there are over 100,000 ER visits each year in the US, due to ladder falls. That's a lot of money spent on medical bills, time out of work, or even lawsuits. Why take unnecessary risks? It seems like a simple decision. When you consider the costs.</p><!-- TODO: insert link -->



                <p>And I'd like to share a little about who we are, and why we're here.</p>
